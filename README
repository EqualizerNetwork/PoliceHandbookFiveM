This modification implements a British Police Handbook into FiveM (Server Side). The command /handbook is used to display a list of commands in the handbook. Hours of training can be done to teach individuals, but a plugin like this is needed to ensure those standards are not forgotten!

This will improve roleplay quality on British policing servers with prompts such as GOWISELY (Stop & Search) easily appearing as a notification on your screen. Similarly, /arrest will prompt the full caution and /nec will list all necessities for an arrest.

/arrest - Arrest Format
/handbook - List all Commands
/nec - PACE (Code G) - Necessities
/tor - Traffic Offence Report
/methane - Major Incident Declaration
/ipp - Initial Phase Pursuit
/136 - s136 Mental Health Act
/ic - Identity Codes (eg, IC1/IC2)
/wm - Warning Markers (eg, FI)
/book - Cell Space Booking Format
This modification is complete however updates will be published in the future improving the amount of commands and features. No bugs identified currently.

1. Drag and drop the “policehandbook” folder into your server directory > cfx-server-data-master > resources.

In the future I plan to develop more British related content similar to the mod seen here, which will improve realism for British players!
